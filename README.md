## Description
STLocationRequest is a simple and elegant way to request the users location services at the very first time written in Swift. The `STLocationRequestController` shows a beautiful 3D 360¬∞ Flyover MapView with over 25 cities and landmarks üó∫.

<br/><br/>

## Installation

STLocationRequest is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'STLocationRequest', '~> 3.0'
```

## Usage

```swift
import STLocationRequest

// Initialize STLocationRequestController with STLocationRequestController.Configuration
let locationRequestController = STLocationRequestController { config in
    config.titleText = "We need your location for some awesome features"
    config.allowButtonTitle = "Alright"
    config.notNowButtonTitle = "Not now"
    config.mapViewAlpha = 0.9
    config.backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGray
    config.authorizeType = .requestWhenInUseAuthorization
}

// Get notified on STLocationRequestController.Events
locationRequestController.onEvent = { event in
    if case .locationRequestAuthorized = event {
        // Location Request Authorized üôå
    }
}

// Present STLocationRequestController
locationRequestController.present(onViewController: self)
```
> Please keep in mind that the 3D SatelliteFlyover only works on a real iOS Device ([Read more](#ios-simulator)).

## Configuration
The `STLocationRequestController` can be customized via the the `STLocationRequestController.Configuration` struct. There are plenty of options available üë®‚Äçüíª More details can be found [here]()

## OnEvent
The `onEvent` closure allows you to get notified if an `STLocationRequestController.Event` occured. For example to detect if the user has authorized or denied the location request or tapped the `Not Now` Button.

```swift
locationRequestController.onEvent = { (event: STLocationRequestController.Event) in
    switch event {
        case .locationRequestAuthorized:
            break
        case .locationRequestDenied:
            break
        case .notNowButtonTapped:
            break
        case .didPresented:
            break
        case .didDisappear:
            break
    }
}
```

Or just simply pass a function üëå

```swift
locationRequestController.onEvent = onLocationRequestControllerEvent

func onLocationRequestControllerEvent(_ event: STLocationRequestController.Event) {
    // Evaluate the event
}
```

## Info.plist

In order to perform a location request you have to define a usage description in your `Info.plist` file.

STLocationRequestController.Authorization.**requestWhenInUseAuthorization**
```swift
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>The usage description</string>
```

STLocationRequestController.Authorization.**requestAlwaysAuthorization**
```swift
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>The usage description</string>
```

This text will be shown in the default iOS location request dialog, which will show up when the user tapped the allow button.

## Presenting-Recommendation

The recommended way to present `STLocationRequestController` is the following way.

```swift
if STLocationRequestController.shouldPresentLocationRequestController {
    // Location Services are enabled and authorizationStatus is notDetermined
    // Ready to present STLocationRequestController
    self.presentLocationRequestController()
}
```

## iOS Simulator

Please keep in mind that the 3D flyover view will only work on a real iOS device with at least iOS 9.0 installed ([Apple Developer API Reference](https://developer.apple.com/reference/mapkit/mkmaptype/1452553-satelliteflyover)). A Screenshot taken from an **iOS Simulator** running a `STLocationRequestController` visualizes the iOS Simulator behaviour.
